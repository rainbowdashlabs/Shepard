quotes:

  - "**Shepard**:\nTogether we can stop Sovreign. We don't have to submit to the Reapers. We can beat them!\n**Saren**:\nI no longer belive that Shepard. The visions cannot be denied. The Reapers are too powerful. The only hope of survival is to join with them. Sovreign is a machine. It thinks like a machine. If I can prove my value, I become a resource, worth maintaining. There is no other logical conclusion.\n**Shepard**:\nYou were a Spectre. You swore to protect the galaxy. Then you broke that vow to save yourself.\n**Saren**:\nI'm not doing this for myself. Don't you see, Sovreign will succeed. It is inevitable. My way is the only way any of us will survive. I'm forging an alliance between us and the Reapers, between organics and machines, and in doing so, I will save more lives than have ever existed. But you would undo my work. You would doom our entire civilization to complete annihilation, and for that, you must die."
  - "**Shepard**:\nYou think I'm crazy, don't you?\n**Wrex**:\nSometimes crazy is the best way to go."
  - "We have no beginning. We have no end. We are infinite. Millions of years after your civilization has been eradicated and forgotten, we will endure.\n- **Sovereign**"

  - "I need you to find some information on - are you ready for the name? - 'Rannadril Ghan Swa Fulsoom Karaten Narr Eadi Bel Anoleis'. No, that's the administrator.\n- **Salarian Businessman** [talking on extranet \"phone\"]"
  - "**Conrad Verner**:\nWhat if you signed me on as another Spectre?\n**Shepard**:\nConrad, I haven't been shot in the head nearly enough times to make that sound like a good idea."
  - "Is submission not preferable to extinction?\n- **Saren**"
  - "**Captain David Anderson**:\nShepard's right. Humanity is ready to do its part. United with the rest of the Council, we have the strength to overcome any obstacle. When the Reapers come, we must stand side by side. We must fight against them as one. And together we can drive them back into dark space!"

  - "**Tali**:\n[in Citadel elevator] So, Dr. T'Soni, all these Prothean ruins we're exploring - this must be like a survey for you.\n**Liara**:\nNot exactly. For one, I am usually alone on my expeditions, and two, they involve much more time for study... and far fewer explosions.\n**Tali**:\nYes, it's a pity that most of the technology I had planned to bring back to the Flotilla has subsequently tried to kill us."
  - "**Tali**:\nHow can you fight your own people?\n**Wrex**:\nAnyone who fights us is either stupid or on Saren's payroll. Killing the latter is business. Killing the former is a favor to the universe."
  - "**Shepard**:\nThe council represents more races than I thought. No wonder they're careful with newcomers.\n**Kaiden**:\nThey probably just want to keep everything running. It has to be hard keeping all these cultures working together.\n**Ashley**:\nOr maybe they just don't like humans.\n**Shepard**:\nWhy not? We've got oceans, beautiful women, this emotion called love. According to the old vids, we have everything they want.\n**Kaiden**:\nWhen you put it that way, there's no reason they wouldn't like you. I mean, us! Humans! Ma'am.\n**Ashley**:\nYou don't take much shore leave, do you, L-T?"

  - "I'm pleased that the imminent destruction of all organic life has improved your career opportunities.\n- **Tali**"
  - "**Charles Saracino**:\nIf aliens express their opinions at gunpoint, then why shouldn't we?\n**Wrex**:\nBecause they have bigger guns?"
  - "We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.\n- **Sovereign**"
  - "**Ashley**:\nWhat *is* that? Some kind of VI interface?\n**Sovereign**:\nRudimentary creatures of blood and flesh. You touch my mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.\n**Ashley**:\nI don't think this is a VI."
  - "The Council can kiss my ass!\n- **Shepard**"
  - "**Asari Councilor**:\nCommander. Is this some kind of game? Are you calling in a report just so you can cut us off again?\n**Shepard**:\nYou know it.\n[disconnects communication]\n**Joker**:\nThat never gets old, does it?"
  - "**Turian Councilor**:\nDo you take pleasure from committing genocide, Shepard?\n**Shepard**:\nDepends on the species, Turian."
  - "**Shepard**:\n[points gun at Conrad Verner's face] Conrad, you have no idea what it takes to get the job done. This is how a gun in your face feels! It happens to me every day. You can't handle this.\n**Conrad Verner**:\n[starts crying] I thought you were a hero! Hero's don't do things like this! I wish I'd never met you."

  - "**Turian Councilor**:\n[the council refuse to believe Shepard, despite the truth of his past claims] I believe there is a saying amongst you humans: \"even a broken clock is correct two times a day.\"\n**Shepard**:\nHere's another saying: *go to hell!*"
  - "**Shepard**:\nI need to activate the neutron purge.\n**Mira**:\nI'm sorry, but the proper authorization code is required.\n**Shepard**:\n[Mumbling] Uh... Sic semper, tyrana...\n**Shepard**:\n[Coughs]"
  - "'Reaper,' a title given to us by the Protheans to give voice to their destruction. In the end what you call us is irrelevant. We simply are.\n- **Sovereign**"
  - "**Asari Councilor**:\nCommander Shepard - step forward.It is the decision of the Council that you be granted all the powers and privileges of the Special Tactics and Reconnaissance branch of the Citadel.\n**Salarian Councilor**:\nSpectres are not trained, but chosen. Individuals forged in the fire of service and battle; those whose actions elevate them above the rank and file.\n**Asari Councilor**:\nSpectres are an ideal, a symbol. The embodiment of courage, determination, and self-reliance. They are the right hand of the Council, instrments of our will.\n**Turian Councilor**:\nSpectres bear a great burden. They are protectors of galactic peace, both our first and last line of defense. The safety of the galaxy is theirs to uphold.\n**Asari Councilor**:\nYou are the first human Spectre, Commander. This is a great accomplishment for you and your entire species."
  - "I don't know what is worse: the geth, or all this sand in my... nevermind!\n- **Liara** [on Virmire]"
  - "You all know the mission, and what is at stake. I have come to trust each of you with my life. But I have also heard murmurs of discontent. I share your concerns. We are trained for espionage. We would be legends, but the records are sealed. Glory in battle is not our way. Think of our heroes: the Silent Step, who defeated a nation with a single shot, or the Ever Alert, who kept armies at bay with hidden facts. These giants do not seem to give us solace here, but they are not all that we are. Before the network, there was the Fleet! Before diplomacy, there were SOLDIERS! Our influence stopped the Rachni, but before that, we held the line! Our influence stopped the Krogan, but before that, we held the line! Our influence will stop Saren! In the battle today, we will hold the line!\n- **Captain Kirrahe**"

  - "[Shepard has just successfully destroyed the claws that kept a geth ship attached to the outside of the ExoGeni tower] This was my kind of mission. Kill a bunch of geth and end things with a huge crash.\n- **Wrex**"
  - "**Juliana Baynham**:\n[Juliana Baynham has asked Cmdr. Shepard to come and hear her idea about how to deal with the Thorian, a creature mind-controlling the local colonists] I'm glad you've decided to help us. I think there's a way to avoid killing the colonists.\n**Shepard**:\nWhat did you have in mind?\n**Juliana Baynham**:\nI think you could safely use a nerve agent to neutralize the colonists.\n**Dr. Lizbeth Baynham**:\nLike a gas grenade!\n**Shepard**:\nReleasing clouds of nerve gas doesn't seem like a particularly good idea.\n**Juliana Baynham**:\nIt's not like it's weapons grade. The insecticide we use in the gro-labs contains trace amounts of Tetraclopine, a neuromuscular degenerator. If their nervous systems are already weakened, it may act as a paralyzing agent.\n**Wrex**:\nIf we must consider it, drop it in a concussion grenade."
  - "[Shepard & squad set off from the Zhu's Hope colony, onto the Prothean Skyway] And now to the geth base. Not something an intelligent being would typically say.\n- **Liara**"

  - "**Garrus**:\n[Shepard, Garrus and Wrex have arrived at Peak 15 and have just won a firefight against some geth. Suddenly, they hear clunking noise, like something moving. Garrus is alerted] What was was that? What was that?\n**Wrex**:\n[Not the least bit unnerved by the sounds] Probably debris. Don't have a panic attack. I'll protect you."
  - "**Alestia Iallis**:\n[an asari scientist enters the lab accompanied by armed geth] Your mission ends here, Shepard.\n**Wrex**:\nWe'll see about that, bitch."
  - "**Shepard**:\n[Shepard has made the decision concerning the rachni] Make your peace with the galaxy. The rachni are a dead race.\n**Garrus**:\nWe can't exterminate them. Not without the Council's approval. Genocide is one of the reasons we fought the krogan - [realizes what he has just said] Ah...\n**Wrex**:\n[Angered] You want to learn about genocide, Vakarian? I'll take you to a krogan obstetrician's office.\n**Rachni Queen**:\nIs our kind so frightening? You would seek our silence if you cannot muffle our songs? If you cannot have us as your obedient claws?\n**Shepard**:\nNo... I can't do this. I'll let you go free.\n**Rachni Queen**:\nYou will give us the chance to compose anew? We will remember. We will sing of your forgiveness to our children.\n**Wrex**:\n[Annoyed] Great. Bugs are writing songs about you. Mark my words. You'll regret this."
  - "**Shepard**:\nI come from a military family too. My parents were both navy. Anybody in your family we might know?\n**Ashley**:\n[Evasive] Couldn't say, Commander. [pause] We probably have a lot in common. You join up to carry on the tradition?\n**Shepard**:\nI'm here to put hyper-velocity rounds through the heads of bad guys.\n**Ashley**:\nMost satisfying part of the job, Commander."
  - "**Shepard**:\nIt's nice to know where I stand with the galaxy. But where do I stand with you?\n**Ashley**:\nAbout a meter away. Maybe 1.2 meters... sir."
  - "**Ashley**:\n[after listening to a message from her sister about how cute Shepard is. Turns around, seeing Shepard right behind her] Please tell me you didn't hear that.\n**Shepard**:\nAfraid I did.\n**Ashley**:\nOh, shoot me now."
  - "**Joker**:\nThrusters, check. Navigation, check. Internal emissions sink engaged. All systems online. Drift... just over 1,500 K.\n**Nihlus Kryik**:\n1,500 is good. Your captain will be pleased. [Leaves]\n**Joker**:\nI hate that guy.\n**Kaiden**:\nNihlus gave you a compliment, so you hate him?\n**Joker**:\nYou remember to zip up your jumpsuit on your way out of the bathroom? That's good! I just jumped us halfway across the galaxy and hit a target the size of a pinhead, so that's incredible! Besides, Spectres are trouble. I don't like having him on board. Call me paranoid.\n**Kaiden**:\nYou're paranoid."
  - "**Garrus**:\nSaren is either a traitor or a madman. Taking him down will restore the good name of turians everywhere.\n**Wrex**:\nGlad to hear it. I was losing sleep over the prospect of people not loving the turians."
