  - "Never before have so many come together from all quarters of the galaxy. But never before have we faced an enemy such as this. The Reapers will show us no mercy. We must give them no quarter. They will terrorize our populations. We must stand fast in the face of that terror. They will advance until our last city falls, but we will not fall. We will prevail. Each of us will be defined by our actions in the coming battle. Stand fast. Stand strong. Stand together. Hackett out. \n- **Admiral Hackett** [before the counterattack on Earth]"

  - "The war is over. The Reapers have been defeated. Against all odds, and in the face of the greatest threat this galaxy has ever known, we survived. We suffered many losses. The relays are severely damaged, but we won. This victory belongs to each of us... every man, woman, and child. Every civilization, on every world. Now, as we take our first steps toward restoring what we lost, we must remember what it took to win. This wasn't a victory by a single fleet, a single army, or even a single species. If this war has taught us anything, it is that we are at our strongest when we work together. And if we can put down our grievances long enough to stop something as powerful as the Reapers, imagine what we can achieve now that they are defeated. It will take time, but we can rebuild everything that was destroyed. Our homes, our worlds, our fleets and defenses. All of this - and more. Together, we can build a future greater than any one of us could imagine. A future paid for by the sacrifices of those who fought and died alongside us. A future that many will never see. And while we still have many challenges ahead of us... We can face them together. And we will honor those who died to give us that future.\n- **Admiral Hackett**"
  - "We knew this war would test us. We knew the chances of victory were slim at best. But we are victorious. The Reapers are defeated. We deployed every strategy, fought every battle, sent every soldier and hero to the brink. We held nothing back. Now, it's up to the survivors to rebuild, to start again. I only hope the lessons learned in this war don't die along with those of us who fought to win it.\n- **Admiral Hackett**"

  - "Suck it up, princesses!\n- **Wrex**"
  - "Now hold your heads high like real krogan! There's a Reaper that needs killing!\n- **Wrex**"
  - "I want you to know that no matter what happens, you've been a champion to the krogan people, a friend of Clan Urdnot and a sister to me! To every krogan born after this day, the name Shepard will mean 'hero'! [notices Reaper troops advancing] Now let's show them why!\n- **Wrex** [Before heading into battle with Shepard] "
  - "A long time ago, my father betrayed me in this place. His own son. He tried to kill me...so I had to kill him, right over there. That's what the genophage reduced us to; animals. But you changed that today, Shepard.\n- **Wrex** [After the genophage is cured]"
  - "That's why I love hanging out with you guys. Why shoot something once, when you can shoot it 46 more times?!\n- **Wrex**"
  - "Shepard, please. My project, my work, my cure. My responsibility. Would have liked to run tests on the seashells.\n- **Mordin**"

  - "We do not view the Old Machines as analogues to deities. However, we have gained perspective on why others would imbue them with those qualities.\n- **Legion** [On the Reapers]"
  - "We do not experience fear as you would, but we have no desire to be exterminated.\n- **Legion**"
  - "Hope sustains organics during periods of difficulty. We...admire the concept.\n- **Legion**"
  - "Shepard-Commander, the geth only acted in defence after the Creators attacked. Do we deserve death?\n- **Legion**"
  - "Don't worry, Shepard. I only forget to recycle the Normandy's oxygen when I've discovered something truly interesting. [pause, Shepard is shocked] That is a joke.\n- **EDI**"
  - "I am alive. All of us, synthetic and organic, have been changed. The war is over, and the Reapers are helping to rebuild. Where once they threatened us with extinction, they now bring us the collective knowledge of the cultures that came before. As a galaxy, we can now live the lives we have wished for; taking our steps into a new and wonderful future, where organics and synthetics can coexist peacefully. With peace across the galaxy and unlimited access to knowledge, to recover the greatness that was lost, and surpass it. We will reclaim our worlds...and the stars. As the line between synthetic and organic disappears, we may transcend mortality itself, to reach a level of existence I cannot even imagine. And we will remember that this chance for a new life did not come without cost. No matter how far we advance, we will remember the sacrifices of those who made it possible. And we will remember Shepard. Because of her, I am alive, and I am not alone.\n- **EDI**"
  - "Shepard, you're staring...\n- **EDI**"
  - "I enjoy the sight of humans on their knees.\n- **EDI**"

  - "**Eve**:\n[rallying the krogan clans to battle the Reapers] Enough! You can stay here and let old wounds fester as krogan have always done... or you can fight the enemy you were born to destroy, and win a new future for our children. I choose to fight. Who will join me?!\n**Commander Shepard**:\nI will.\n**Urdnot Wrex**:\nAnd so will I! Now hold your heads high like true krogan! There's a Reaper that needs killing!"
  - "[After Shepard's first meeting with the Prothean, Javik]\n**Javik**:\nThis has been...amusing.\n**Shepard**:\nOh?\n**Javik**:\nTo discover the most primitive races of my time now rule the galaxy. The asari, the humans, the turians...\n**Liara**:\nThere's also the salarians.\n**Javik**:\nThe lizard people evolved?\n**Liara**:\nI believe they're amphibian.\n**Javik**:\nThey used to eat flies."
  - "**EDI**:\nShepard, you are now possibly the only living organic who has experienced the Geth Consensus. Do you feel different?\n**Shepard**:\nIt was fascinating, mind-blowing... And I'm also a bit thirsty.\n**EDI**:\nAnd just like that, the magic is gone.\n**Shepard**:\nDid you just say what I think you said?\n**EDI**:\nNo."
  - "[Tali converses with Garrus through the intercom]\n**Tali**:\nOkay, toughest mission.\n**Garrus**:\nHorizon.\n**Tali**:\nNo fair. I hadn't joined up with you, yet.\n**Garrus**:\nFine, the dead Reaper, then.\n**Tali**:\nReally? The husks just ran up to us.\n**Garrus**:\nHave you ever noticed that I carry a sniper rifle? You're the one who likes things at short range.\n**Tali**:\nAnd you prefer to keep everything at a distance.\n**Garrus**:\nExactly...wait, what?"
  - "**Tali**:\nI'm having a drink with my girlfriend. My human girlfriend. Ha, my father would have hated you!\n**Shepard**:\nHere's to him then.\n**Tali**:\nAnd to Miranda. Nice job, you genetically perfect Cerberus cheerleader bosh'tet! Keelah se'lai!"
  - "**Garrus**:\nThe whole time I worked at C-Sec, I'd stare at the top of the Presidium and say to myself: I want to go up there. But I never did. There were 137 regulations telling me I couldn't.\n**Shepard**:\nSo you got them changed?\n**Garrus**:\nNo. Now I just don't give a damn.\n[Flies up and parks the hovercar on one of the skyways]"
  - "**Shepard**:\nDid you lose anyone back on Earth?\n**Conrad Verner**:\nNo. I mean, Extranet friends, and such, but I don't have any family left.\n**Shepard**:\nWhat about your wife?\n**Conrad Verner**:\nUm...\n**Shepard**:\nConrad, do you even have a wife?\n**Conrad Verner**:\nOh, yes! Yes, yes, yes... Well no, but see-\n**Shepard**:\nConrad, if you have some kind of weird shrine of me, I'm gonna be very unhappy.\n**Conrad Verner**:\nIt's just a poster with a few candles. It's very tasteful.\n**Shepard**:\nGah..."
  - "**Tali**:\n[Looking at the sunset on Rannoch] It is beautiful, though, isn't it?\n**Shepard**:\n[Looking directly at Tali] Yeah... it is.\n**Tali**:\nIt will be years before we can live without our suits completely, but right now...[Takes off her mask, looking at the sunset unobstructed] Right now, I have this..."
  - "**Admiral Hackett**:\nShepard, let me tell you something that I've learned the hard way. You can pay a soldier to fire a gun. You can pay him to charge the enemy and take a hill. But you can't pay him to believe.\n**Shepard**:\nI don't follow, sir.\n**Hackett**:\nWhen you went up against Sovereign, there was no good reason to believe you'd win. But your crew didn't seem to care — they went along anyway. Your trip through the Omega 4 relay? That was a suicide mission if there ever was one. Yet there your crew was, standing beside you, proud to serve. With all you're facing out there, one thing impresses me most: you inspire confidence. I know everything hasn't gone as well as you'd hoped. Every war has its disagreements, so to speak. But, your crew has done things no one else would even try — simply because you asked them to. Why? Because they BELIEVED in you. Their leader. That's what I need now."
