  - "**Garrus**:\nDo you ever miss those talks we had on the elevators?\n**Tali**:\nNo.\n**Garrus**:\nCome on. Remember how we'd always ask you about life on the flotilla? It was an opportunity to share!\n**Tali**:\nThis conversation is over.\n**Garrus**:\nTell me again about your immune system.\n**Tali**:\nI have a shotgun.\n**Garrus**:\nMmmmaybe we'll talk later."

  - "**Jack**:\nI'm not going anywhere with you! You're Cerberus!\n**Shepard**:\nWhy does it matter if I'm with Cerberus?\n**Jack**:\nThey've been on my ass for years. Anytime I get free, they put a huge bounty on me. That's why Warden Kuril figured he'd struck gold when he caught me.\n**Miranda**:\nShe's destroyed Cerberus property and killed Cerberus people, hence the bounty.\n**Jack**:\n[to Miranda] You die first."
  - "**Shepard**:\nIf you want to help Urdnot you'd need to get back there. But It would take a real bad-ass to make it back while injured.\n**Sick Krogran**:\nI can do it.\n**Shepard**:\nYou! I said a bad-ass not some scout whining like a quarian with a tummy-ache.\n**Tali**:\nI'm standing right here!"

I tried to move in closer but one of the bastards punched a shot clean through my suit!\n**Shepard**:\nHow bad is your suit damage?\n**Kal'Reegar**:\nCombat seals clamped down to isolate contamination, and I'm swimming in antibiotics. The geth might get me but I'm not going to die from an infection in the middle of a battle. That's just insulting!"
  - "**Shepard**:\n[discussing 'sparring'] So when should I book the room?\n**Garrus**:\nI'd wait if you're OK with it. Disrupt the crew a little as possible. Take that last chance to find some calm just before the storm. You know me, always like to savor that last shot before popping the heatsink.\n[Shepard gives Garrus a knowing smirk]\n**Garrus**:\nWait... that metaphor just went somewhere horrible."

  - "This, recruits, is a 20-kilo ferrous slug. Feel the weight. Every five seconds, the main gun of an Everest-class dreadnought accelerates one to 1.3 percent of light speed. It impacts with the force of a 38-kiloton bomb. That is three times the yield of the city-buster dropped on Hiroshima back on Earth. That means Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son-of-a-bitch in space.\n- **Gunnery Chief**"
  - "**Harrot**:\nTentatively excited: Welcome human. What can I get for you?\n**Shepard**:\nTell me about your \"deal\" with the quarian over there.\n**Harrot**:\nSuspicious: If I had made such a deal, I would not be inclined to discuss it. Accusatory: I don't understand how it is any concern of yours.\n**Shepard**:\nWhat if you and I make a deal? You let him set his own prices, and I won't break your legs.\n**Harrot**:\nWith barely contained terror: You drive a hard bargain, human.\n**Shepard**:\nI haven't even started.\n**Harrot**:\nResignation: Very well. I will release the quarian from his promise."
  - "**Joker**:\n[after giving EDI control of the ship] Argh! You want me to go crawling through the ducts again.\n**EDI**:\nI enjoy the sight of humans on their knees.\n**EDI**:\n[Upon seeing Joker with a worried expression on his face] That is a joke.\n**Joker**:\nRight."
  - "Ah yes, Reapers. The immortal race of sentient starships allegedly waiting in dark space. We have dismissed that claim.\n- **Turian Councilor**"
  - "**Shepard**:\nTake a good long look at me. Do I look like a looter?\n**District Guard**:\nUh, no.\n**Shepard**:\nThat's right. Now, I'm going in. If I find looters, I'll kill them. Anybody gets in my way, I'll kill them, too.\n**District Guard**:\n[Worried] I'll call the guards. They'll let you in with no trouble.\n**Refugee**:\nWait, you're stopping me but not them? You son of a bitch!\n**District Guard**:\nYou don't have a grenade launcher, lady. Get lost."

  - "**Shepard**:\nI take it you're a scientist?\n**Fortack**:\nI used to be a scientist. I designed weapons. Now my genius is wasted on frivolous things. Things that don't explode. My predecessor said no one would understand the true worth of my work. As I pulled my blade from his chest, I knew he was telling the truth.\n**Shepard**:\nNot exactly what I would call effective academic peer review."
  - "Hard to see big picture behind pile of corpses.\n- **Prof. Mordin Solus**"

  - "**Miranda**:\nThis radiation is causing serious problems for my shields.\n**Grunt**:\nThen we fight from the shade... but no hiding."

  - "**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nKenneth and I have been partners in crime since we graduated from tech academy. When he got the Cerberus offer, I insisted that it include me. He'd fall apart without me.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nThanks, mum."

  - "I'll relinquish one bullet. Where do you want it?\n- **Shepard** [When asked to relinquish weapons]"
  - "**Volus**:\nDo you have anything a little more flashy? I want something that says: \"I own this room. I own YOU.\"\n**Asari Merchant**:\n[sigh] I'll see what I can do, sir."
  - "Either you pay me or I flay you alive... with my mind.\n- **Liara**"
  - "**Shepard**:\nHow are you holding up?\n**Grunt**:\nYou're soft, Shepard. My fingers's length in your back and i can sever your spine. You're just like the Salarians and Asari, all soft. Turians and Quarians, they're tougher. It takes more to get through a Turian, but there really isn't much point.\n**Grunt**:\n[Chuckles, and with quotation finger gestures] \"Much point.\" Ah, never mind."
  - "**Shepard**:\nYou'd better not stab me in the back, Grunt.\n**Grunt**:\nI would never stab you in the back, Shepard. Military like you and me? Straight to the face.\n**Grunt**:\n[after a brief pause] Kidding! Kidding!"
  - "**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nSo Kenneth, do you know we've got a crazy woman squatting down in the sub-deck?\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nWhat? If she touches anything, I'll kill her.\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nOh, and the only thing she wears from the waist up is tattoos.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nOh! Maybe I should go down and welcome her aboard.\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nAnd she's a murderer who has biotic powers that could crush you in a blink. Hates everyone in Cerberus.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nDamn it girl! Stop toying with me!"
  - "**EDI**:\n[Shepard launches a probe at Uranus] Really, Commander?\n[Shepard launches a second probe]\n**EDI**:\n[exasperated] Probing Uranus."
  - "You're got two ways down, express, or coach.\n- **Shepard** [Threatening to push a merc to his death]"
  - "**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nHey Kenneth, you hear Rupert is actually making good food now?\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nYeah, but he couldn't make a good haggis to save his life!\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nYeah, but all haggis tastes like ass anyway.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nAye, but in the right hands, it can taste like mighty fine ass!"
  - "Definitely like old times.\n- **Garrus** [after dodging an explosion]"
  - "**Sick Krogran**:\nI can do it! I'm up! And I'm going to the female camp!\n**Shepard**:\nDamn right you are. Get back there and show them what you're worth! Go, go!\n**Sick Krogran**:\nRAAAHHHHHHH!"
  - "**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nSo Gabby, what do you think of our new quarian boss?\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nShh, she's right over there.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nShe can't hear us with her head in that bucket. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful bucket. The whole suit is lovely, quite snug in all the right places.\n**Tali**:\nYou know I can hear you.\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nHa!"
  - "**Shepard**:\nI'm sorry, I know that was important, but *you* performed Gilbert and Sullivan?\n**Prof. Mordin Solus**:\n[singing] I am the very model of a scientist salarian - I've studied species Turian, Asari and Batarian - I'm quite good at genetics as a subset of biology - because I am an expert which I know is a tautology! My xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian - I am the very model of a scientist salarian!\n[long pause]\n**Prof. Mordin Solus**:\nAhem."
  - "Go get 'em, Chiktikka! Good girl.\n- **Tali** [Launching a combat drone]"
  - "**Shepard**:\nI couldn't do this without you, Garrus.\n**Garrus**:\nSure you could. Not as stylishly, of course."
  - "Why is it always claws and guns? Why can't we piss off a fuzzy planet? Still dangerous, but hey, bunnies.\n- **Joker**"
  - "**Shepard**:\nHave you got a minute to talk?\n**Prof. Mordin Solus**:\nPerhaps later. Trying to determine how scale itch got onto Normandy, sexually transmitted disease only carried by varren. Implications... unpleasant."
  - "I'll dance next to you, if you want to think we're dancing together go ahead.\n- **Shepard**"
  - "**Conrad Verner**:\nYou wanna see how far I'll go? I learned how to shove a gun in people's faces from... Commander Shepard?\n**Matriarch Aethyta**:\nHey, if you know this idiot, can you rein him in before I slap his ass with a singularity?"
  - "**Shepard**:\nHave a minute to talk?\n**Prof. Mordin Solus**:\nNot now, I think I just developed a cure for Joker's illness! No, wait, causes liver failure, never mind..."
  - "I can already hear it... \"This is all Joker's fault! What a tool he was! I have to spend all day computing pi because he plugged in the Overlord!\"\n- **Joker** [Preparing to give EDI full access to the ship]"
  - "**Miranda**:\nI don't know what this is, if this is stress or just blowing off steam or...\n**Shepard**:\nI care about you, Miranda. And I think you care about me.\n**Miranda**:\nThis is no time for emotional entanglement! You and I know more about the Collectors than anyone, we know how unlikely it is we're coming back alive! What idiotic bunch of hormones thought that now was a great time for love?\n**Shepard**:\nWho said anything about love? I'm just trying to get you into bed.\n**Miranda**:\nYou ass...\n**Shepard**:\nCome on, Miranda. You know you want this.\n**Miranda**:\nI do..."
  - "**Shepard**:\nI trust you too Tali, but you don't have to prove anything to me.\n**Tali**:\nI know... well no not that I know... it's just that... well... it's not normally like this... I mean, wow... when did it get so hot in here?"
  - "And don't forget to see Elcor Hamlet live! An unforgettable fourteen hour experience!\n- **Illium advertisement**"
  - "Aim for her head, because she doesn't have a heart.\n- **Salarian** [about Nassana]"
  - "[Racing to save the ship from the Collectors]\n**Joker**:\nShit shit shit shit shit...\n**EDI**:\nActivating emergency H-fuel cells!\n**Joker**:\nWhat the shit?"
  - "**Garrus**:\nI remember this one mission, me and this recon scout had been at each other's throats, nerves mostly. She suggested we settle it in the ring.\n**Shepard**:\nI take it you went easy on her?\n**Garrus**:\nActually, she and I were the two best hand to hand combatants on the ship. I had reach, she had flexibility. It was brutal. After 9 rounds, the judges declared it a draw. A lot of unhappy bettors in the other room. We, uh, ended up having a tiebreaker in her quarters. I had reach, she had flexibility. More than one way to work off stress, I guess..."
  - "Hey, Commander, we got Garrus back! You know, he was always my favorite... with that pole up his ass...\n- **Joker**"
  - "I'm glad Garrus finally worked that stick out of his ass... But now he's trying to beat people to death with it.\n- **Joker**"
  - "**Harkin**:\nWait! I can't just give client information away! It's bad for business.\n**Garrus**:\nYou know what else is bad for business? [Garrus kicks Harkin in the face and rests a foot on his throat] A broken neck!"
  - "**Liara**:\nShe's got reinforcements!\n**Shepard**:\nWhat kind of guns does this thing have?\n**Liara**:\nIt's a taxi! It has a fare meter!\n**Shepard**:\nWonderful."
  - "If Mom could see me now, we'd have zombies on top of everything else.\n- **Joker**"
  - "And if this thing starts claiming to be the \"vanguard of our destruction,\" then I got shotgun on the first lifeboat, okay?\n- **Joker** [after EDI mentions she has Reaper hardware]"
  - "You know what I hate about deep space? Crap radio stations from two hundred years back. My gosh, we were idiots.\n- **Joker**"
  - "You know what pisses me off? Calling this the cockpit. Alliance ships have bridges. Asari have cockpits. Oh wait, no they don't.\n- **Joker**"
  - "I was thinking of installing some lava lamps. Maybe some Christmas lights for ambiance. What do you think?\n- **Joker**"
  - "**Shepard**:\nWhat do you think our chances are Garrus?\n**Garrus**:\nHonestly? The Collectors have killed you once, and all it seems to have done is piss you off so..."
  - "You know Commander I'm not real broken up that Wrex isn't coming. I'm good with your current amount of head-butting. I'd say we're at head-butting capacity.\n- **Joker**"
  - "[the Normandy is about to be attacked by a Collector ship]\n**Joker**:\nCan't dodge this guy forever, EDI! Get us the hell out of here!\n**EDI**:\nSpecify a destination, Mr. Moreau.\n**Joker**:\nAnywhere that's not here!"
  - "**Liara**:\n[surrounded by enemy troops] Their attacks are disorganized. They'd be more effective if they all attacked at once.\n**Shepard**:\nPlease don't give the mercs ideas."
  - "[If you bring Legion on Tali's loyalty mission]\n**Captain Kar'danna**:\nGet that damn thing off my ship before you start an incident that makes the Ascension Project fiasco with Cerberus look like a slow day on garbage detail!\n**Shepard**:\nWhen I take Tali aboard Council stations, the customs guys sometimes call her \"that thing.\" This thing is named Legion.\n**Captain Kar'danna**:\nHow about you step aside and we call it scrap metal?\n**Legion**:\nOur exterior shell is 72% polymer."
  - "**Shepard**:\nI need Grunt back up to speed. What's wrong with him?\n**Wrex**:\nThere's nothing wrong with him. He's becoming a full adult.\n**Garrus**:\nAdolescence? Can't we just take him to Omega and buy him a few dances?"
  - "**Liara**:\nSo tell me what you want. If this all ends tomorrow, what happens to us?\n**Shepard**:\nI don't know. Marriage, old age, and a lot of little blue children?"
  - "**Harbinger**:\nKill one and one hundred will replace it."
  - "**Shepard**:\nMy name is Shepard, and I'm here to get you off this ship.\n**Jack**:\nI'm not going anywhere with you. You're Cerberus.\n**Shepard**:\nI'm offering to be your friend. You don't want to be my enemy.\n**Jack**:\nYou show up in a Cerberus frigate to take me away somewhere? You think I'm stupid?\n**Shepard**:\nThis ship is going down in flames. I've got the *only* way out. I'm offering to take you with me, and you're arguing!\n**Legion**:\nReccommend Subject-Jack be disabled and transported aboard as cargo."
  - "**Shepard**:\nYou're awfully anxious to get Samara out of your district.\n**Detective Anaya**:\nMy bosses want me to detain her. They're worried she'll cause some kind of cross-species incident. But her Justicar Code won't let her be taken into custody. If I try it, she'll have to kill me.\n**Shepard**:\nYour superiors are sending you to certain death for no good reason. You have a right to disobey.\n**Legion**:\nShepard-Commander orders us to statistically probable death an average of 2.73 instances per day. Rounded down."

But her Justicar Code won't let her be taken into custody. If I try it, she'll have to kill me.\n**Shepard**:\nYour superiors are sending you to certain death for no good reason. You have a right to disobey.\n**Garrus**:\nWe can disobey suicidal orders? Why wasn't I told?\n**Tali**:\nThat's about twice a day."
  - "**Shepard**:\nI assume everything is going well up here?\n**Joker**:\nWe're just having an argument over personalization of my workspace.\n**EDI**:\nCerberus regulations are clear, Mr. Moreau. \"Personalization\" does not include grease on my bridge cameras."
  - "**Jacob**:\nCommander. We've done what we could for Garrus, but he took a bad hit. The docs corrected with surgical procedures and some cybernetics. Best we can tell, he'll have full functionality, but...\n[Garrus walks in]\n**Garrus**:\nShepard.\n**Jacob**:\nTough son of a bitch. Didn't think he'd be up yet.\n**Garrus**:\nNobody would give me a mirror. How bad is it?\n**Shepard**:\nHell, Garrus, you were always ugly. Slap some face-paint on there, and no one will even notice.\n**Garrus**:\nHa-ah! Don't make me laugh, damn it. My face is barely holding together as it is. Ah, probably for the best. Everyone was always ignoring you and hitting on me. Time for you to get a fair shot at it."
  - "This subject will invent fiction it believes the interrogator desires. Data acquired will be invalid.\n- **Legion** [while watching a prisoner be tortured during an interrogation]"
  - "This is not unlike our stations. Far more inefficient. Your organic shells require more space. Information propagation is slow. Many voices speak at once. We do not understand how it functions without consensus. Perhaps study of other hive species will illuminate. Beginning extranet search protocols.\n- **Legion** [about the Citadel]"
  - "**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nGabby, you'd say the Normandy is a she, not a he, right?\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nOf course. The Normandy's the sweetest girl there is.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nAnd EDI's a she. Tali's definitely a she.\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nWhat are you getting at, Kenneth?\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nI'm just saying I'm feeling a wee bit threatened here. A lot of female energy, and I'm just one man.\n**Engineer Gabriella Daniels**:\nYou're such a dick.\n**Kenneth Donnelly**:\nSee! Look where your mind went. I've got to watch out for myself."
  - "**EDI**:\nPrimary defense systems are offline. We can save the Normandy, Mr. Moreau, but you must help me. Give me the ship.\n**Joker**:\nWhat? You're crazy. You start singing \"Daisy Bell\" and I'm done."
  - "**Shepard**:\nI assume everything is going well up here?\n**Joker**:\nYou know, this is really nice. EDI took up the slack in almost every department. I could get used to this kind of help.\n**EDI**:\nIt is not my intention to assume all of your responsibilities, Jeff.\n**Joker**:\nNo, no, no, I'm good. Just keep me updated. Quietly.\n**Shepard**:\nEDI isn't a crutch. I want your eyes on everything.\n**Joker**:\nEyes are easy, Commander. I've got eyes covered.\n**EDI**:\nI believe covering your eyes would be counter to Shepard's intention."
  - "But... great wind! Biotic god! I'm... I... what was I saying? I'm... tired. You... may be right. Yes, I'm tired... I'll nap. Destroy the universe later...\n- **Niftu Cal** [after being pushed over by Shepard]"

  - "**Shepard**:\nHave you got a minute?\n**Garrus**:\nCan it wait for a bit? I'm in the middle of some calibrations."
  - "Why I follow you, Shepard, big things!\n- **Grunt** [upon seeing the Geth colossus on Tali's recruitment mission]"
  - "**Miranda**:\n[Shepard and Miranda run into each other] Oh! Pardon me, Commander...\n[Puts her hand on his chest and whispers in his ear]\n**Miranda**:\nI've cleared the engine room. I'll be there in 5 minutes.\n**Shepard**:\nI should've known you wouldn't settle for the captain's quarters.\n**Miranda**:\nI settle for nothing but the best.\n[Walks into the elevator and gives Shepard a wink as the door closes]"
  - "You collect stray cats as a kid? Because we really needed a mega-krogan, so thanks for dragging him home.\n- **Joker** [First comment when Shepard comes to talk to Joker after releasing Grunt] "

  - "**Weyrloc Clanspeaker**:\nI am the speaker for Clan Weyrloc, offworlders. You have shed our blood. By rights, you should be dead already. But Weyrloc Guld, the Chief of Chiefs, has ordered that you be given leave to flee and spread the message of our coming.\n**Shepard**:\nIf I flee, I might trip over the dozen krogan I killed to get here. I think I'll take my chances."
  - "**Shepard**:\nWould you like to talk about what happened with Tali?\n**Legion**:\nUnnecessary. Creator Tali'Zorah was afraid of us. Shepard-Commander is afraid of us. We understand. Organics do not choose to fear us. It is a function of your hardware.\n**Shepard**:\nTrue. But I should be above that. I'm saying that I regret what happened. I have no reason to distrust you. You've been perfectly loyal to us all along.\n**Legion**:\nOur analysis of organic humor suggests an 87.3% chance that you expect us to respond with, \"You are only human.\""
  - "**Shepard**:\nIt looks like this place has recovered from Sovereign's attack.\n**Avina**:\nRepair of the damage from the geth attack is ongoing. There is still extensive damage on Tayseri Ward.\n**Shepard**:\nGeth? It was Sovereign who led the attack. A Reaper.\n**Avina**:\nI have no information on a \"Reaper.\" References to this term exist in some para-historical theories on galactic extinction cycles.\n**Legion**:\nSocial engineering. The Council blames the geth. Repeat the lie enough, they will not worry about the Reapers."
  - "Shit, you sound like a pussy.\n- **Jack**"
  - "We appreciate your patience. Please continue to hold.\n- **EDI** [EDI is realigning the colony's GARDIAN lasers, while Shepard is defending the transmitter tower, trying to stay alive against the Praetorian] "
  - "**Shepard**:\nSo, the man cleaning the toilets is also preparing the meals?\n**Mess Sergeant Rupert Gardner**:\nHey, I wash my hands... most of the time."
  - "**Captain Enyala**:\n[to Miranda] I was just waiting for you to finish getting dressed. Or does Cerberus really let you whore around in that outfit?\n**Jack**:\nI like her. Are we still recruiting?"
  - "**Ereba**:\nKrogans live long lives. It's not like dating a human, where you just stick it out for a century until they die.\n[Shepard glares at Ereba]\n**Ereba**:\nUh, no offense."
  - "**Wrex**:\nNow, Shepard. What brings you here? How's the Normandy?\n**Shepard**:\nDestroyed in a Collector surprise attack. I ended up spaced.\n**Wrex**:\nWell, you look good. Ah, the benefits of a redundant nervous system!\n**Shepard**:\nYeah, humans don't have that.\n**Wrex**:\nOh. It must have been painful, then."
  - "**Shepard**:\nHave you got a minute to talk?\n**Prof. Mordin Solus**:\nSome other time. About to test new bio weapon. Not on us, of course. Didn't think I had to specify, but Joker got nervous."
  - "**Shepard**:\nHave you got a minute to talk?\n**Prof. Mordin Solus**:\nHaving trouble working between your interruptions and EDI's insistence that \"insane\" experiments endanger the entire crew. Hard to concentrate. Bad for morale."
  - "**Sergeant Haron**:\nSorry for the inconvenience, ma'am. Our scanners are picking up false readings. They seem to think you're, ah, dead.\n**Shepard**:\nI was only mostly dead. Try finding that option on government paperwork."
  - "**Shepard**:\nIt's been awhile since I've passed through here. Security seems to have tightened a bit\n**C-Sec Customs**:\nAfter the Geth attack, there was a review of security protocol. A few minor changes were made to reduce the risk of Geth infiltration. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n**Legion**:\nGeth do not infiltrate.\n**C-Sec Customs**:\nYou should leave your personal synthetic assistant at home. They're not allowed on public shuttles any more.\n**Legion**:\nGeth do not intentionally infiltrate."
  - "Can it wait for a bit? I'm in the middle of some calibrations.\n- **Garrus Vakarian**\n"
